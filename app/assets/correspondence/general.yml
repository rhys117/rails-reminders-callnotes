Speedtests - how to: |
  Hi NAME, 

  Thanks for your time on the phone today. As discussed below is instructions on how to run some speedtests so we can investigate any speed problems your service is experiencing. 

  NTD----------------------------------------------------- 
  Please connect a computer directly to the nbn NTD UNID1 port with an ethernet cable and ensure that the wifi has been turned off or is disconnected during any speedtests. 
  NTD----------------------------------------------------- 

  PPPOE----------------------------- 
  You'll have to setup a PPPoE connection the computer to do so please follow these steps: 

  1. Click on Start button and then, Control Panel. Go to Network and Sharing Center. Select on Set up a new connection or network. 
  2. A wizard will appear on the screen. Choose Connect to the Internet. 
  3. Select Set up a new connection anyway. 
  4. Select Broadband (PPPoE). 

  Enter your PPPoE details: 
  PPPoE Username: USERNAME 
  PPPoE Password: PASSWORD 

  5. Follow the prompts on screen to connect. 
  PPPOE------------------------------------------- 

  If you complete speedtesting via our website using the following link we'll receive the results and you won't have to keep your own record. - speedtest.skymesh.com.au 

  If you cannot complete speedtesting via our website please perform speedtests on beta.speedtest.net and either copy the result ID or take a screenshot of the results including the date and time which should be on the computers clock in the bottom right of the screen. 

  If there is an problem nbn require speedtests to completed over at least two days both inside and outside of peak utilization periods (generally between 5pm - 10pm). This means we recommend one speedtest in the morning and one in the evening or late afternoon. Please be aware that we unfortunately cannot guarantee the speed of our network 24/7, this means if you are only experiencing slow down during peak utilization periods there may not be a fault we can escalate. 

  NTD----------------------------------------------------- 
  If you are having speed problems please also ensure that you test two different ethernet cables connected between the computer and the nbn NTD. 
  NTD----------------------------------------------------- 

  MODEM/FTTN---------------------------------------------- 
  If you are having speed problems please also ensure that you test two different phone cables between the modem and the phone port. Please also ensure you are plugged into the main phone port with no filters between the modem and the phone socket. 
  MODEM/FTTN---------------------------------------------- 

  If you are still in need of assistance please respond to this email or call us on 1300 759 637.

Speed Concerns: |
  Hi NAME, 

  Thank you for contacting us. We understand that issues with the speed of your service are important and understand your frustration. We would like to work together with you to resolve your concerns regarding your service. 

  For us to be able to assist with investigating a possible issue with the speed of your NBN service we require speed testing to be done with at least four tests over two days, one during outside and one during peak network utilization period (5pm - 10pm) on each day. We understand that this is time consuming but we use this data to identify faults and to communicate with the NBN Co on your behalf. Detailed speed test data helps us to get the best results for you. 

  If you are not already doing so, please ensure you are running the speed tests via the Ookla speed test hosted on the SkyMesh server at http://netgauge.skymesh.net.au/. All tests should be performed using a single Ethernet cable to connect your computer to the W-NTD. 
  Keep in mind that your speed will vary depending on a number of factors and you are not guaranteed to get 100% of the peak speed of your service 100% of the time. The Fixed Wireless service is supplied on a best effort basis. 

  Your maximum throughput may vary for reasons that include but are not limited to: 
  a) The number of simultaneous end users being served by the nbnâ„¢ network; 
  b) Third Party Supplier network congestion; 
  c) Internet Congestion; 
  d) Contention Ratios; 
  e) Faulty equipment; 
  f) Your Wi-Fi connection; and 
  g) Errors in the configuration of your equipment, home network or software. 

  If you are currently running speed tests while connected via Wifi, please try connecting your computer to your wireless router with an Ethernet cable, disabling the Wifi on your computer. Speeds via Wifi can be affected by many factors including distance, interference from other signals and hardware configurations/standards. Because of this, we will only use speed tests performed using Ethernet connections when diagnosing issues and lodging faults with the NBN Co. 

  As soon as you have a critical mass of data, please contact us. A team member will verify your speed-testing results and may request additional troubleshooting to support escalating this ticket. 
  If you have any questions, please call SkyMesh Support on 1300 759 637 or reply to this email..
