  Hi NAME,

  We tried to contact you today on NUMBER but unfortunately we were unsuccessful. 

  It is now becoming compulsory to migrate your service to remain on our network. Your onnet service is active and ready to use however we've noticed you don't appear to have made the switch yet. Please change your router to UNIDPORT on the nbn NTD  and ensure your router is configured for DHCP (Dynamic IP) instead of PPPoE. 

  If you are experiencing any problems with the transition please let us know if we can offer any assistance by contacting us on 1300 759 637 or by replying to this email.

  Regards,
