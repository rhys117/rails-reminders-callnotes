  Hi NAME,

  We tried to contact you today on NUMBER but unfortunately we were unsuccessful. 

  Your service change complete and is active and ready to use however we've noticed you don't appear to have made the switch yet. Please change your router to NEW_UNIDPORT on the nbn NTD  and ensure your router is configured for PPPoE instead of Dynamic IP (DHCP). 

  ***Insert Router Guide if nesccissary***

  If you are experiencing any problems with the transition please let us know if we can offer any assistance by contacting us on 1300 759 637 or by replying to this email.

  Regards,
  
  SkyMesh Support
Snippet - UNIV: |
  Unfortunately due to a change in your service we can no longer offer you a UNIV service however we can provide a VOIP service at the same cost, we just need to know if you'd like to go ahead with the swap. 

  If you would like to make the change to VOIP we'll send you a permanent-loan ATA free of charge which you'll need to connect to your router and then connect your phone to the ATA rather than the nbn NTD. Please be aware that you'll need to return this unit if you ever terminate your connection with us to a reply-paid address (free of charge). During the changeover, if everything goes as expected, you may experience a short period (1-2 days) where your phone number will not be in service.

  Please let us know if you would like to make this change by contacting us on 1300 759 637 or replying to this email.
